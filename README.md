# TASK DESCRIPTION

Speech Recognition System Using Python
The goal of this project is to build a basic Speech-to-Text system using Python and pre-trained models from the speech_recognition library. The system allows users to speak naturally into a microphone, captures their voice, and then transcribes the spoken words into written text using Google's Speech Recognition API.
This solution is designed to work with a microphone input, where the program first calibrates ambient noise for a few seconds to improve accuracy. Once calibrated, it listens for the user's voice, records the audio input automatically when speech starts, and stops recording when speech ends. The audio is then processed and transcribed into text. Both the audio recording and the resulting transcription are saved to files with time-stamped filenames for reference or later use.
The project leverages the speech_recognition Python package, which acts as a wrapper for several speech APIs. In this implementation, we use Google Web Speech API, which is reliable and free for basic usage.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Features
üéôÔ∏è Real-time microphone input
üîä Ambient noise adjustment for accuracy
‚è±Ô∏è Automatic recording start/stop based on speech
üß† Speech-to-text transcription using Google API
üìÅ Saves audio (.wav) and text (.txt) outputs with timestamps
üí¨ Clear console feedback for the user

üí° Applications
This basic speech recognition system has wide applications in both personal and professional environments:

1. Voice Notes and Dictation
Users can use this system to quickly convert their spoken thoughts into text, helping with journaling, brainstorming, or dictating articles and reports.

2. Accessibility
It can assist users with physical disabilities or limited typing ability by providing an easy way to input text vocally.

3. Hands-Free Operation
In workspaces like kitchens, labs, or industrial environments, where hands are occupied, this system can be useful for taking voice-based notes or commands.

4. Education
Students can use this tool to transcribe lectures, practice pronunciation, or convert spoken answers into written text for learning or exam prep.

5. Integration in Applications
This system serves as a foundation for building:
Voice-controlled applications
Personal voice assistants
Interactive chatbots
Language learning tools

This speech recognition system demonstrates how accessible and powerful voice technology has become with modern tools. By combining Python and pre-trained models, developers can integrate voice control and transcription features into their apps in just a few lines of code. The simplicity of the solution also makes it an excellent starting point for students, hobbyists, or developers looking to explore AI-powered interfaces.
